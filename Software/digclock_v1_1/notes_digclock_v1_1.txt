I currently have I2C digclock code.
- Displays time

I was wondering if I could use BLE and RTOS to change the time.

RTOS: CE4370 Lab 2 - Polls and Interrupts
BLE: " Lab 8

RTOS uses xTaskCreate and vTaskDelay.
- Perhaps one task to display the time.
- Another task to accept messages from BLE?

There wasn't a need to use RTOS, it worked with just BLE!
